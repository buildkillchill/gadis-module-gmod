# Gadis

A bot that bridges the gap between a Garry's Mod server and a Discord server.


### Why Garry's Mod and not any source engine game?
It could be adapted for any source engine game, since it uses RCON for the ranks, but Gadis was made specifically for a GMod server called Build, Kill, Chill. I have no intention of making it available to any other game my self, so if you want it to work for other games feel free to fork it. If you make it where it is compatible with multiple games, feel free to submit a PR.

### What about feature ______?
If I don't have it implemented, feel free to fork it and DIY. You can submit a PR after it's done and if I like it, I'll implement it.
